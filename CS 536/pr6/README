The build system for this skeleton project is Apache Ant.  You
shouldn't need to modify anything in the build file or support scripts
to have them work, provided the ant command is in your path.  On
CSL-supported workstations, it can be found in /s/std/bin.

You will need to add the Antlr JAR files to your CLASSPATH and .ant/lib
directory as described at
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs536-1/projects/pr2/antlr.html.

The build file defines three targets:
 * clean (removes all compiled .class files)
 * compile (default, builds the project)
