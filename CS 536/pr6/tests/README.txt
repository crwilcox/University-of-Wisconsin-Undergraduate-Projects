Tests for project 6, of course.

They are split up by feature. Note that there are some tests that are
in the directory which suggest they would apply, but they won't
because of other choices.

For instance, arrays/1d/global.c has a test of an array global. This
test is only applicable if you choose to implement *both* arrays *and*
globals.


If it's not clear what tests apply to a feature let me know.
