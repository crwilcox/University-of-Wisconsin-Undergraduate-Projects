the heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their relation to our earth is concerned the one class a very small one comprises a sort of colony of which the earth is a member these bodies are called planets or wanderers there are eight of them including the earth and they all circle round the sun their names in the order of their distance from the sun are mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune and of these mercury the nearest to the sun is rarely seen by the naked eye uranus is practically invisible and neptune quite so these eight planets together with the sun constitute as we have said a sort of little colony this colony is called the solar system
