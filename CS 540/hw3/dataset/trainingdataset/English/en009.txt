we must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact little family swimming in an immense void at distances which would take our shell not hundreds but millionspg  of years to traverse we reach the starsor rather a star for the distances between stars are as great as the distance between the nearest of them and our sun the earth the planet on which we live is a mighty globe bounded by a crust of rock many miles in thickness the great volumes of water which we call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust above the surface an ocean of invisible gas the atmosphere rises to a height of about three hundred miles getting thinner and thinner as it ascends
