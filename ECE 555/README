NOTE: LVS has one more pmos as we split one to make it fit.  The netlist still 
	match, and it correctly operates in spectre.

Dicussion:

PPGEN: PPGEN was designed to be minimal in size because even small its delay
 should not cause it to be on a critical path. Since the inverter of the  ppgen_en
 signal drives 32 devices, we made the inverter size large. This caused us to have to
 split the pmos so our LVS report for ppgen has 1 more pmos than the schematic.

Ripple Carry:
 A ripple carry was chosen to minimize area. This however made the ripple
 chain the critical path delay. The carry signals were driven through an
 inverter larger than base size to help speed up this critical path.

Regfile:
 The regfile took advantage of our previous assignments D flip flop.
 Control singals that needed to be inverted were sent through inverters
 as large as could fit above the D-flops. This module is very dense and
 tiny movements in the metal layers would cause it to fail DRC.

FSM:
 Our fsm design was one-hot in order to simplify the logic.
 The control signals are piped out on metal three to the rest of the circuit.
 Close observation will note a 4-flop chain for a control signal.
 When a last minute bug cropped up in the state machine, we had a decision.
 We could have either ripped up the entire state machine or simply added
 this four-flop chain to delay an internal signal. We chose the 4-flop chain
 because doing so did not increase our total chip area.

Shifter:
 The shifter is implemented as a 32 bit logarithmic shifter.  It was designed
 hierarchally of 1-bit shifters with upper, lower, and current inputs.  The
 1-bit shift units were implemented as a dynamic circuit.  While this passed LVS, 
 it was found in spectre that the signal degraded too much after going through
 the complete shifter.  To remedy this, complimentary inverters were added to 
 boost the signal to a stable state.  This added roughly 11um in one direction of
 the layout.  We believe this is a minimum cost to ensure proper function of 
 the shifter unit.

Floor Planning:
 We broke the design into different modules that could be independently tested.
 This allowed for maximum reuse and made making global modification quick and convenient.
 Metal 2 was used primarily for buses, where Metal 3 were used to interconnect the different
 modules.  Metal 1 and poly were used for the internal signals to each module.  By trying 
 follow these guidelines, the connectioin at the toplevel went quite smoothly, as we could
 predict how our inputs/outputs would be connected.  We were also able to share vdd and gnd
 rails between modules, resulting in less area, and same circuit function.  This did create
 extra work as the taps between modules had to match up as to not fail DRC, but we believe
 that the end result justifies the added effort.
