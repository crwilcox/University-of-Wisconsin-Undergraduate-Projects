 Part 5. (20 points extra credit) Implement the Karger-Klein-Tarjan randomized algorithm
for constructing minimum spanning trees.
Whether there is a linear time method to construct minimum spanning trees is an open question
in computer science. Such a method would need to run in O(m + n), where m is the number of
edges and n is the number of nodes. The Karger-Klein-Tarjan algorithm runs in expected linear
time. It is randomized and its worst case could be nonlinear.
This algorithm is described in Kevin Wayne’s slides. Before you implement this algorithm you
should have done Parts 1, 3 and 4 of this assignment. In other words, no credit for this part until
you get the 3 deterministic algorithms for minimum spanning tree running.
