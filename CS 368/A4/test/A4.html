<HR>
<H3>Send e-mail questions to Aaron, <a HREF="mailto:xfeng@cs.wisc.edu">xfeng@cs.wisc.edu</A>

<H3>Collaboration Policy</H3>
<p>
For this assignment,
you may work in pairs (2 people).
All students (whether working in a pair or not) must individually
turn in the assignment by individually running the <i>handin</i> program.
Therefore, 2 copies of the assignment will be turned in
for those working as a pair.
The grader will choose to grade only one copy of a pair's work,
and assign the same score to both students.
<p>
If working in a pair, the names of BOTH students
must appear at the top of the turned in assignment.

<H2>Program</H2>

<p>The purpose of this program is to write some C++ code,
as part of a program
that uses pointers, structures, objects, and needs a copy constructor.
</p>

<H3>Program Statement</H3>

<p>
We have written most of a C++ program for you.
It implements a <code>Queue</code> class, and elements of the queue
are the toy implementation of <code>Process</code> objects.
</p>

<p>
The main program is a vehicle for testing the <code>Queue</code> and
<code>Process</code> classes,
so it manipulates <code>Queue</code>
objects as well as the <code>Process</code> objects that a
queue holds.
</p>

<p>
The code for this programming assignment are in the 5 files:
<ul>
<li> <code>/p/course/cs368-smoler/public/html/assignments/A4/main.cpp</code>
<li> <code>/p/course/cs368-smoler/public/html/assignments/A4/Queue.cpp</code>
<li> <code>/p/course/cs368-smoler/public/html/assignments/A4/Queue.h</code>
<li> <code>/p/course/cs368-smoler/public/html/assignments/A4/Process.cpp</code>
<li> <code>/p/course/cs368-smoler/public/html/assignments/A4/Process.h</code>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Copy each of these files to your own directory.
You will modify <code>Queue.cpp</code> and <code>main.cpp</code>
for this assignment.
Do not change any files other than these two, as you will not be turning
in the other files, and your code must work with the other files in their
original form.
Missing from the program are implementations (definitions)
of 3 <code>Queue</code> member functions:
<code>enqueue</code>,
<code>dequeue</code>, and the copy constructor.
Add them, and modify <code>main()</code> such that it tests
all 3 of these completed functions.
</p>

<p>
Note that we are completely ignoring proper memory management
for this program.
This assignment is intended only to give practice programming
in C++, and using pointers.
You will get your chance to properly implement memory managment
in assignment 6.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>
For this assignment, do all your work (especially compilation)
on the instructional Unix machines.
Be a bit careful, as code compiled on one of the 64-bit machines
may not execute on the 32-bit machines, and visa versa.
Perhaps it is best to choose one flavor, and do the entire
assignment on that flavor.
</li>
<li>
To compile a C++ program, use the compiler accessed with
<code>g++</code> on the instructional Unix machines.
Your program is expected to compile without warnings or errors
when using <code>g++</code>.
If the name of a single C++ source code program were
<code>p1.cpp</code>, then the
Unix command
<br>
<code>
g++ p1.cpp
</code>
<br>
will compile this program, placing the executable program
in the file <code>a.out</code>.
Note that this command (given in this manner)
must be executed while your current working directory
(often abbreviated cwd) is the one
containing the C++ source code file.
To place the executable in a file other than <code>a.out</code>,
add another option and argument to the command line:
<br>
<code>
g++ p1.cpp -o executablename
</code>
<br> <br>
To compile a multifile program, list all the <code>.cpp</code>
files in the compilation command.
So, to compile the this  assignment's program, you may use the
command
<pre>
g++ main.cpp Process.cpp Queue.cpp -o tryit
</pre>
where your executable will then be named <code>tryit</code>.
<br> <br>
And, if you know lots about compilers, please do not set any
flags or other options when compiling.
We want to see no warnings or errors when we compile
with <code>g++</code>.
</li>
<li>
To run a program, the name of the executable becomes
the command.
If your executable is named <code>a.out</code>, then
the Unix command to execute this program will be
<br>
<code>
  a.out
</code>
<br>
or
<br>
<code>
  ./a.out
</code>
</li>
<li>
A note to those very few students who do not read carefully:
the machine <b>route66</b> is <i>NOT</i> one of the instructional
machines assigned for use by this class.  In fact, it is
a different platform, and its compilers are linked differently.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Grading</h3>
To receive the grade of <b>Credit</b> for this class,
this program must receive a minimum score of 70/100.
To achieve the 70% score, the program <i>must</i>
compile without errors, such that it can be executed.
<p>
It should also mostly
<ul>
  <li>Have proper inline documentation of the 3 added functions.
  Follow CS 302 or CS 367 guidelines, if you need an indication of
  what constitutes proper inline documentation.
  <li>Have at least partially working implementations of the
  3 added functions.
  <li>Have code added to <code>main()</code> that intends to test
  the functionality of <code>Queue</code>'s copy constructor.
</ul>

<h3>Handing In the Program</h3>

<p>We are using the lab-supported <i>handin</i> program,
to turn in programs online.

<p>You are modifying and turning in two files.
We have all the other files, and we will use our copies 
when compiling and testing your program.

<p>Your source code files turned in will be
<code>Queue.cpp</code> and <code>main.cpp</code>.
Turn in your program by running the lab-supported handin program.
Instead of following the lab's directions, use this exact command
<p>
<pre>
<code>
  /s/handin/bin/handin -c cs368-1 -a a4 -d . 
</code>
</pre>
while your current working directory is
the one containing the two source code files.
This program copies the specifically named file to
a directory accessible by the instructor and TA.
<p>
Some advice, as this is the first assignment turned in online:
<ul>
<li>Try running the <i>handin</i> program well before the 
assignment due date.
We will not accept programs turned in by e-mail,
and excuses will likely not help.
<li>A successful hand in will print a message of the form:
<pre>
The following files where handed in successfully:
main.cpp
Queue.cpp
</pre>
If one or both of the files are <i>not</i> listed,
then something has gone wrong, and you have not yet turned
in the program.
<li>Subsequent executions of the <i>handin</i> program 
overwrite the files turned in with an earlier execution
of the <i>handin</i> program.
</ul>
