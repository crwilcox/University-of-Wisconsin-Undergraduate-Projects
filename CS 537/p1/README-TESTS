
To get going on the tests, simply copy two files into your current project directory:

  cp ~cs537-1/testing/p1/run-tests.csh .
  cp ~cs537-1/testing/p1/generate.py .

To run all the tests, simply type:

  ./run-tests.csh

To run a specific test, type:

  ./run-tests.csh <testNumber>

as in

  ./run-tests.csh 12

Running a specific test may be useful to debug a particular problem you
are having. 



Here are some short descriptions of what the tests are supposed to check:

 0 too many command-line arguments
 1 input file: does not exist
 2 output file: cannot open
 3 input has same name as output
 4 input has different name but is actually same file

 5 simple file: in file and out file
 6 simple file: in file (and out to stdout)
 7 simple file: (in from stdin and out to stdout)

 8 empty input file 
 9 empty input file (stdout)
10 empty input file (stdin/stdout)

11 last line has no \n
12 last line has no \n (stdout)
13 last line has no \n (stdin/stdout)

14 long file 
15 long file (stdout)
16 long file (stdin/stdout)

17 long line 
18 long line (stdout)
19 long line (stdin/stdout)

20 malloc fails (sometimes)
