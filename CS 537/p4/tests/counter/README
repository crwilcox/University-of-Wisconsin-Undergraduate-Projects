
Basic idea:
- testcount.c stress test your libcounter.so
- if your lib is thread-safe, you should get a "congrats" message
- if not, you will get an "argghh" message
- run runTest on machine that has more than one processor

Do this first:
- before compiling and running this program, please
  copy all these files into your working directory
- make sure you have your own *.h

Run:

% ssh best-emperor
% cd [go to your working directory]
% make clean
% make
% ./runTest
