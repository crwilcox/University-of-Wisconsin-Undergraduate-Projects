1) assuming you have libhash.so ready
2) make sure you have neccessary header (YOUR own header)
3) you may want to modify makefile to add target to compile your lib
4) REMEMBER: testhash.c is the program to test the libhash, 
   so the make file assume you have libhash.so

To do:
- make
- ./runTest
